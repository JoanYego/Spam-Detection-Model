# Spam-Detection-Model

This repository contains a spam classification model developed using Naive Bayes.


# Project Description

The goal of the analysis is to develop a classification model that will categorize an email as either spam or not spam. Spam emails are unwanted digital communication or messages that get sent mostly in bulk. In the current digital age where most communication, both professional and personal, occurs through digital platforms, it is imperative that unsolicited messages are detected since they are essentially a waste to time and resources. The analysis uses a Naive Bayes Classifier to build a prediction model that will categorize emails as either spam or not spam. Later on, the model is optimized to ensure a high prediction accuracy.

The data used in this analysis was sourced from the University of California, Irvine's websit and comprises of a collection of both spam and non- spam emails. The dataset contains 4,602 records and 58 columns.
